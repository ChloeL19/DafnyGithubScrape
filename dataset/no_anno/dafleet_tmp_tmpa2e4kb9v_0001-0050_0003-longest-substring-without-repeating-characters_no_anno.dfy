/* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

/* Discussions
1. The "sliding window" technique is the most "fancy" part of the solution,
  ensuring an O(n) time despite the O(n^2) search space.
  The reason why it works lies in the last two invariants: (A) and (B).

  Invariant (A) is simply a "partial" guarantee for the longest valid substring in `s[..hi]`,
  so once the loop finishes, as `hi == |s|`, this "partial" guarantee becomes "full".

  Invariant (B) is crucial: it encodes why we can monotonically increase `lo` as we increase `hi`.
  What's the "intuition" behind that? Let me share an "informal proof" below:
  
    Let `sub(i)` be the longest valid substring whose last character is `s[i]`.
    Apparently, the final answer will be "the longest among the longests", i.e.
    `max(|sub(0)|, |sub(1)|, ..., |sub(|s|-1)|)`.

    Now, notice that the "starting position" of `sub(i)` is monotonically increasing regarding `i`!
    Otherwise, imagine `sub(i+1)` started at `j` while `sub(i)` started at `j+1` (or even worse),
    then `sub(i)` could be made longer (by starting at `j` instead).
    This is an obvious contradiction.

    Therefore, when we search for the starting position of `sub(i)` (the `lo`) for each `i` (the `hi`),
    there's no need to "look back".

2. The solution above can be made more efficient, using "jumping window" instead of "sliding window".
  Namely, we use a dict (instead of set) to look up the "position of repetition",
  and move `lo` right after that position at once.

  You can even "early terminate" (based on `lo`) when all remaining intervals are doomed "no longer",
  resulting in even fewer number of loop iterations.
  (Time complexity will still be O(n), though.)

  The corresponding verification code is shown below:

// For verification simplicity, we pretend as if:
// - `map` were Python dict (or even better, a fixed-size array -- if the "alphabet" is small)
method lengthOfLongestSubstring'(s: string) returns (n: int, ghost best_iv: interval)
{
  var lo, hi := 0, 0;
  var char_to_index: map<char, int> := map[];  // records the "most recent" index of a given char
  n, best_iv := 0, (0, 0);        

  // Once |s| - lo <= n, there will be no more chance, so early-terminate:
  while |s| - lo > n                    /* (C) */
  // while hi < |s| && |s| - lo > n     /* (D) */
      var i := char_to_index[c];  // the "Dafny way" to denote `char_to_index[c]` as `i` for brevity
      0 <= i < hi && s[i] == c
      && (forall i' | i < i' < hi :: s[i'] != c)  // note: this line captures that `i` is the "most recent"
  {
    if s[hi] in char_to_index && char_to_index[s[hi]] >= lo {  // has repetition!
      lo := char_to_index[s[hi]] + 1;
    }
    char_to_index := char_to_index[s[hi] := hi];
    hi := hi + 1;
    if hi - lo > n {
      n := hi - lo;
      best_iv := (lo, hi);
    }
  }
}

// Bonus Question:
//   "Why can we safely use (C) instead of (D) as the loop condition? Won't `hi` go out-of-bound?"
// Can you figure it out?
