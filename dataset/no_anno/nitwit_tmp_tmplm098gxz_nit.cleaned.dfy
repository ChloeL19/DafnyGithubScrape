/*
  In this program, I'm hoping to define
  N's complement: a generalized form of 2's complement.

  I ran across this idea back in ECE 341, when I asked
  the professor about a crackpot theoretical "ternary machine".
  Looking into it, I came across a general form of 2's complement.

  Suppose I had the following 4 nit word in base base 3:

  1 2 0 1 (3)

  Now, in two's complement, you "flip" the bits and add 1. In
  n's complement, you flip the bits by subtracting the current
  nit value from the largest possible nit value. Since our base
  is 3, our highest possible nit value is 2:

  1 0 2 1 (3)

  Note how the 1's don't change (2 - 1 = 1), but the "flipping"
  is demonstrated in the 2 and 0. flip(2) in base 3 = 0, and flip(0)
  in base 3 = 2.

  Now let's increment our flipped word:

  1 0 2 2 (3)

  Now, if this is truly the n's complement of 1 2 0 1 (3), their
  sum should be 0:

    1 1 1
    1 2 0 1
  + 1 0 2 2
  ---------
  1 0 0 0 0 (3)

  Now, since our word size if 4 nits, the last nit gets dropped
  giving us 0 0 0 0!

  So basically I want to write a Dafny program that does the above
  but verified. I don't know how far I will get, but I essentially
  want to write an increment, addition, and flip procedures such
  that:

  sum(v, increment(flip(v)) = 0, where v is a 4 nit value in
  a given base n.

  In this program, we deal with bases that are explicitly greater
  than or equal to 2. Without this fact, virtually all of our
  postconditions will not be provable. We will run into issues
  of dividing by 0 and what not.
*/
predicate valid_base(b : nat) {
predicate valid_base(b : nat) {
  b >= 2
}

/*
  Now we are in a position to define a nit formally. We say
  a natural number n is a "nit" of some base b if 0 <= n < b.
  0 and 1 are 2-nits ("bits") since 0 <= 0 < 2 and 0 <= 1 < 2.
*/
predicate nitness(b : nat, n : nat)
{
  0 <= n < b
}

/*
  We define incrementing a nit (given its base). When you add two digits
  together, you "carry the one" if the sum is >= 10.

   1
    7
  + 3
  ---
   10

  Addition simply takes two collections of things and merges them together.
  Expressing the resulting collection in base 10 requires this strange
  notion of "carrying the one". What it means is: the sum of 7 and 3
  is one set of ten items, and nothing left over". Or if I did 6 + 7,
  that is "one set of 10, and a set of 3".

  The same notion applies in other bases. 1 + 1 in base 2 is "one set
  of 2 and 0 sets of ones".

  We can express "carrying" by using division. Division by a base
  tells us how many sets of that base we have. So 19 in base 10 is
  "1 set of 10, and 9 left over". So modding tells us what's left
  over and division tells us how much to carry (how many sets of the
  base we have).

/*
  Okay next we are going to define the flip operation. In binary,
  flip(0) = 1 and flip(1) = 0. We can generalize it to any base
  by defining it as so:

  let q be the max possible value of a given base. This
  is b - 1. Given some nit n of b, the flip(n) is q - n.

  For base 2, q = b - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. flip(0) = 1 - 0 = 1,
  and flip(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.

  For base 3, q = 3 - 1 = 2. flip(0) = 2 - 0 = 2,
  flip(1) = 2 - 1 = 1, and flip(2) = 2 - 2 = 0.

  To begin with, we define a predicate is_max_nit which
  is true if some natural q == b - 1.
*/

  Next we define a meta-operator (on a base b) that
  returns the max nit. To make Dafny (and our inner
  mathmatician) happy, we need to require that b is
  a valid base, and explicitly say max_nit(b) is
  a nit of b, and that max_nit(b) is_max_nit(b).
  I found these made the actual flip operation provable.
*/

  Now we define the flip operation proper. For this to work,
  we need is_max_nit and a kind of silly proof to make Dafny
  happy.

  Doing one step would give us:
