// The code in this file demonstrates complications in compiling to C# if a
// trait (like "object") is allowed as a type parameter to something compiled.
// The problem is that an assignment like a "set<MyClass>" to a "set<object>", which
// is allowed in Dafny, would require a deep copy in C#.  Another example is an
// assignment of a "MyDatatype<MyClass>" to a "MyDatatype<object>".
// Currently, the Dafny compiler enforces restrictions that rule out the expensive
// cases.  A possibly more friendly approach would be to emit code that performs
// the deep copies.
// Note that this is not a problem in JavaScript, which lacks type parameters.

  var t: set<nat>;

  // the same way in C#
