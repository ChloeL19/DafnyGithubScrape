// Sorting: 
//        Pre/Post Condition Issues - An investigation 
//                                      -- Stephanie McIntyre
// Based on examples in class 

// First Attempt at specifying requirements for sorting array A in incrementing order
// We want our Hoare triple of (|Pre-Condition|) Code (|Post-Condition|) to hold iff A is properly sorted.

method sort(A: array<int>, n: int)
/* Pre-Condition */   requires n>=0;            
/* Post-Condition */  ensures forall i,j:: 0<=i<=j<n ==> A[i]<=A[j];  //This states that A is sorted.

//Can we write code that does not sort A that still satisfies the requirements? 
//Consider the following program:
{
  var k := 0;
  while(k<n)
  {
    A[k] := k;
    k := k+1;
  }
}
