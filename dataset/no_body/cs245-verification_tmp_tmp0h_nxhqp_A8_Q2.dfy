// A8Q2 â€” Steph Renee McIntyre
// Following the solutions from Carmen Bruni

method A8Q1(x: int, y: int, z: int) returns (m: int)
/*Pre-Condition*/   requires true;
/*Post-Condition*/  ensures m<=x && m<=y && m<=z;
{/* TODO */ }

/* Proof of implieds can be seen on LEARN.
    Note: If you are unconvinced, putting asserts for each condition will demonstrate the correctness of the statements.
