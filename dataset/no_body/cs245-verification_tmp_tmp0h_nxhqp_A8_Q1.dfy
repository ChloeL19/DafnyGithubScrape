// A8Q1 â€” Steph Renee McIntyre
// Following the solutions from Carmen Bruni

// There is no definition for power, so this function will be used for validating that our imperative program is correct. This is just for Dafny.
function power(a: int, n: int): int //function for a to the power of n
  requires 0 <= n;
  decreases n;{if (n == 0) then 1 else a * power(a, n - 1)}


method A8Q1(y0: int, x: int) returns (z: int)
requires y0 >= 0;
/*Post-Condition*/ ensures z==power(x,y0);
{/* TODO */ }

/* Proof of implieds can be seen on LEARN.
    Note: If you are unconvinced, putting asserts for each condition will demonstrate the correctness of the statements.
