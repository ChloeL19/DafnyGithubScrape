lemma Q1_logical_equivalence_as_a_conjunction_of_two_implications__PROOF_BY_TRUTH_TABLE__in_a_comment(L: bool, R: bool)
	ensures (L <==> R) <==> (L ==> R) && (!L ==> !R)
{
	/*
		This lemma states that logical equivalence (L <==> R) can be proved in two steps:
		(1) that L implies R, and that (2) the negation of L implies the negation of R.
		
		As can be seen here (by the curly braces "{" on line 4 and "}" below this comment), Dafny accepts this claim we no problem.

		Your goal in this exercise is to use the truth tables we've learned for conjunction and negation in lecture01.dfy,
		for logical implication in lecture02.dfy, and for logical equivalence (bi-directional implication) in lecture03.dfy,
		to prove correctness of this claim (such that the final column will have T on each line).
		
		See as an example for this kind of exercise the truth table in lines 13-21 of tutorial03.dfy;
		there, however, the stated property was not correct (as we ended with the truth value T only on 6 of the 8 lines)

		YOUR_SOLUTION_SHOULD_BE_WRITTEN_HERE (inside this comment, to the human reader, not to Dafny):

		L	R	!L	!R	"L ==> R"	"!L ==> !R"	"(L ==> R) && (!L ==> !R)"	"(L <==> R)"	"(L <==> R) <==> (L ==> R) && (!L ==> !R)"

	ensures A+(B*C) == (A+B)*(A+C)

	In this exercise you are expected to write a *full* proof for the lemma;

	starting on line 167 of lecture04.dfy and continuing on lines 3-44 of tutorial04.dfy;
	note that the proof must be fully justified for the human reader,
	with labels to assertions and the relevant reveal statements where needed,
	as can be seen in the "Distributivity2a" lemma from the tutorial
	(in contrast to the lemma "Distributivity1a" from the lecture, where we did not add labels);
	in case of syntax errors, you solution will NOT be checked.
